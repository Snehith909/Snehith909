  #### ✅ Features

  - Insert at start
  - Insert at last
  - Insert after a node
  - Delete at start
  - Delete at last
  - Delete the middle node
  - Search for a value
  - Print the list

#### 2)  Doubly Linked List 

This project implements a **Doubly Linked List (DLL)** from scratch using Python. It supports standard operations like insertion, deletion, searching, and traversal.

 📁 Project Structure

- `Node` class: Represents a node in the doubly linked list.
- `DLL` class: Handles all list operations like insertion, deletion, search, etc.
- Driver code at the bottom demonstrates how to use the DLL class.

 ✅ Features

- Insert at start
- Insert at end
- Insert after a given node
- Delete first node
- Delete last node
- Search for a value
- Print the list

#### 3) 🌀 Circular Linked List (CLL)

This project implements a Circular Linked List in Python using a last pointer for efficient operations. It supports core functionalities like insertion, deletion, search, and traversal.

✅ Features:

 - Insert at start or end

 - Insert after a specific node

 - Delete from start, end, or by value

 - Search for an item

 - Print the list


#### 4) Circular Doubly Linked List i
This project implements a Circular Doubly Linked List (CDLL) data structure using Python. It supports common operations such as insertion, deletion, searching, and displaying the list.

🔁 What is a CDLL?
A Circular Doubly Linked List is a variation of a doubly linked list where:

The last node's next points to the first node.

The first node's prev points to the last node.

Each node contains data, a pointer to the previous node, and a pointer to the next node.

✅ Features
- Insert at the beginning

- Insert at the end

- Insert after a specific node

- Search for an element

- Delete the first node

- Delete the last node

- Delete a node by value

- Display all elements in the list

####  5)  Stack 
This repository contains a simple implementation of a Stack data structure using Python lists.
 
🚀 Features
 - is_empty(): Checks whether the stack is empty.

 - push(data): Adds an element to the top of the stack.

 - pop(): Removes and returns the top element of the stack. Raises an error if the stack is empty.

 - peek(): Returns the top element without removing it. Raises an error if the stack is empty.

 - size(): Returns the number of elements in the stack.

#### 6) Stack Implementation Using Singly Linked List  
This project contains a simple implementation of a Stack data structure using a singly linked list in Python. The Stack supports common operations like push(), pop(), peek(), and displaying all elements.

 🚀 Features
 - push(data):	Adds an element to the top of the stack.
 - pop():	Removes and returns the top element of the stack.
 - peek():	Returns the top element without removing it.
 - is_empty():	Checks whether the stack is empty.
 - print_all(): Prints all elements of the stack (top to bottom).
