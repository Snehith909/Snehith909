#### 2)  Doubly Linked List 

This project implements a **Doubly Linked List (DLL)** from scratch using Python. It supports standard operations like insertion, deletion, searching, and traversal.

 📁 Project Structure

- `Node` class: Represents a node in the doubly linked list.
- `DLL` class: Handles all list operations like insertion, deletion, search, etc.
- Driver code at the bottom demonstrates how to use the DLL class.

 ✅ Features

- Insert at start
- Insert at end
- Insert after a given node
- Delete first node
- Delete last node
- Search for a value
- Print the list
