#### 3) 🌀 Circular Linked List (CLL)

This project implements a Circular Linked List in Python using a last pointer for efficient operations. It supports core functionalities like insertion, deletion, search, and traversal.

✅ Features:

 - Insert at start or end

 - Insert after a specific node

 - Delete from start, end, or by value

 - Search for an item

 - Print the list

#### 4) Circular Doubly Linked List i
This project implements a Circular Doubly Linked List (CDLL) data structure using Python. It supports common operations such as insertion, deletion, searching, and displaying the list.

🔁 What is a CDLL?
A Circular Doubly Linked List is a variation of a doubly linked list where:

The last node's next points to the first node.

The first node's prev points to the last node.

Each node contains data, a pointer to the previous node, and a pointer to the next node.

✅ Features
- Insert at the beginning

- Insert at the end

- Insert after a specific node

- Search for an element

- Delete the first node

- Delete the last node

- Delete a node by value

- Display all elements in the list

####  5)  Stack 
This repository contains a simple implementation of a Stack data structure using Python lists.
 
🚀 Features
 - is_empty(): Checks whether the stack is empty.

 - push(data): Adds an element to the top of the stack.

 - pop(): Removes and returns the top element of the stack. Raises an error if the stack is empty.

 - peek(): Returns the top element without removing it. Raises an error if the stack is empty.

 - size(): Returns the number of elements in the stack.

#### 6) Stack Implementation Using Singly Linked List  
This project contains a simple implementation of a Stack data structure using a singly linked list in Python. The Stack supports common operations like push(), pop(), peek(), and displaying all elements.

 🚀 Features
 - push(data):	Adds an element to the top of the stack.
 - pop():	Removes and returns the top element of the stack.
 - peek():	Returns the top element without removing it.
 - is_empty():	Checks whether the stack is empty.
 - print_all(): Prints all elements of the stack (top to bottom).

#### 7) Queue 
This project implements a Queue data structure using Python lists.
A Queue follows the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle, where the first element added is the first one removed.

 
🚀 Features
- Enqueue (add element to rear)

- Dequeue (remove element from front)

- Get front and rear elements

- Check if queue is empty

- Get the size of the queue

- Print the queue elements

https://github.com/Snehith909/Snehith909/blob/5132573b6a89ce97d28333b7060b39443c462586/10)%20Queue

#### 8) DEQUE (Double-Ended Queue) Implementation

This repository contains a simple Python implementation of a **Deque (Double-Ended Queue)** using a list.  
It supports insertion and deletion from both the front and rear ends.



 🚀 Features

- Insert at Front
- Insert at Rear
- Delete from Front
- Delete from Rear
- Check if Deque is Empty
- Get Size of the Deque
- Display the Deque Elements

#### 9) DOUBLEDEQUE - Python Double-Ended Queue (Deque)
This project implements a Double-Ended Queue (Deque) using a Doubly Linked List in Python.
A deque allows insertion and deletion of elements from both the front and rear ends efficiently.

🔧 Features
 - Insert at front (insert_at_first)

 - Insert at rear (insert_at_rear)

 - Delete from front (delete_at_front)

 - Delete from rear (delete_at_rear)

 - Display all elements (print_all)

 - Check if deque is empty (is_empty)

#### 10) Priority Queue
This is a basic implementation of a Priority Queue using Python lists. In this queue, elements are inserted based on their priority, with lower priority numbers served first.

🚀 Features
 - Insert elements with a given priority.

 - Remove elements with the highest priority (lowest number).

 - Check if the queue is empty.

 - Get the current size of the queue.
